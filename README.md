# Stylus User CSS

This repository contains vijay's personal collection of **Stylus user CSS styles** designed to customize and improve the appearance of websites directly in the browser.

The goal of this project is simple:
**make the web more comfortable, consistent, and developer-friendly** by applying global or site-specific CSS overrides—without touching the original website code.

These styles are especially useful if you:

- Want consistent typography across multiple websites
- Prefer your own font choices over default site fonts
- Like fine-tuning UI/UX for better readability and focus
- Use Stylus to personalize the web to your taste

## What is Stylus User CSS?

[Stylus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) is a browser extension that allows you to apply custom CSS to any website.
User CSS runs **locally in your browser**, meaning:

- No changes to the actual website
- No impact on other users
- Full control over how sites look _for you_

This project provides **ready-to-install CSS files** that work out of the box with Stylus.
